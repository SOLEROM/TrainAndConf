Introduction

    History
    What are design patterns?
    GoF design patterns
    Typical problems in embedded systems
    Design patterns in embedded systems

Creational Patterns

    Example - motor: interfaces
    Example - position tracking system: goods transport system
    Reusing the position tracking system for airplanes
    Design pattern Factory Method and Abstract Factory
    Design pattern Prototype and Singleton

Structural Patterns

    Design pattern Adapter
    Example: counter classes
    Design pattern Decorator
    Example: multithreading
    Design pattern Proxy
    Synchronization, Protection, Virtual and Remote Proxy
    Smart pointer

Behavioral Patterns

    Example: timer
    Design pattern Observer
    Design pattern Command
    Example: state machine
    Conventional implementation in C
    Porting to C++
    Design pattern State
    Example: user-defined memory management
    Partition and PartitionManager
    Flexible memory management using different Managers
    Dynamically configurable memory assignment strategy
    Design pattern Strategy
    Algorithms with fixed basic structure
    Design pattern Template Method

Implicitly Covered Patterns, Further Patterns

    Facade
    Composite
    Memento
    Chain of responsibility
    Flyweight
    Iterator
    Mediator

Practical Exercises

    Storage space and runtime measurement
    Design patterns as a means to improve performance
    Using patterns for debug purposes (workshop)
    Further development of a given project by using design patterns; the trainer will discuss all solutions individually with the respective training participants
